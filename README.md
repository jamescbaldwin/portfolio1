# secondhomework
Repository "secondhomework" contains the initial portfolio for James Baldwin, and will utilize Bootstrap to assist in creating a navigatable webpage with functioning links that pertain to his portfolio. All links are intended to be device-responsive, per the instructions outlined. 

In reality, this repo simply contains a page without functioning navbar links. Too much time was spent not solving this issue, rather than exploring device-responsiveness, which was the entire purpose of the assignment. Alas, it's over (for the night, anyway).
